# Project_Local_Library_1

## Summary
The local library project works to create a library for a local neighborhood using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
to give users information about available books to checkout and the most popular authors/books/genres.
I built this to continue my practice of using higher order functions and supply neighborhoods with a way to track books.

## Tools Used
- JavaScript
- Built in JS functions
